// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1. create a variable to represent the current number
let myNumber = 122;
// 2. create a variable to represent the current total
let sumTotal = 0;
// 3. write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
let i = 1;
while (i <= myNumber) {
  sumTotal += 1;
  i++;
}
console.log(sumTotal);
// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1. write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
